# Order parameters in 2D
This script calculates the global and local version of two well established order parameters: 
6-fold bond orientational order, Ψ<sub>6</sub>, and 6-fold crystalline connectivity, C<sub>6</sub>.
These order parameters take in the positions of a two dimensional configuration of spherical 
particles, or discs, and loosely output the level of 6-fold crystalline order. The global versions
run from 0 to 1 and 0 to ~6 for Ψ<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>6</sub> respectively, though C<sub>6</sub>
can be normalized to run from 0 to 1 for a given system size.
